# Untitled-Platformer

A work in progress. The development is streamed (mostly) daily on discord.

## Dependencies (for now)
- [SDL](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL) (will change to a DirectX backend in the future)
- [stb_image.h](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h) (maybe my own png parser?)

## Future Plans 
- Platformer
- Combat
- Ranged and Melee weapons
- Enemies
- Audio/Music
- Puzzles?
- Procedural?
